    "activity_description": "A Shikhara is a traditional Gondola type light rowing boat which is mostly seen on the pristine Dal Lake, apart from other lakes. It is one of the most incredible and relaxing aspects of a holiday in Kashmir, and should be included in your itinerary if you want to experience the surreal beauty of this region to the fullest. Along with the houseboats, it is also considered to be a cultural symbol. But even apart from leisure and tourism purposes, the shikhara is also used by the locals for seaweed harvesting, fishing and transportation. To watch these beautifully decorated boats glide serenely on the lake is a treat to the eyes, and you should definitely not miss out on this experience during your holidays in Jammu and Kashmir.",
